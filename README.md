# VEIL / ONE

This repository contains an ultra-minimal single-page site for VEIL / ONE. The experience is intentionally restrained — "ISSUED, NOT RELEASED." — and no launch language is used.

Details:
- Monochrome, institutional aesthetic
- Single interactive entry: "ISSUED, NOT RELEASED." button
- The button reveals a subtle system layer containing a classic Snake game (canvas, vanilla JS)
- Accessible, responsive, respects prefers-reduced-motion

Deployment:
This project is ready for GitHub Pages. The files are committed to the `main` branch. No additional steps are required — enable Pages in the repository settings if not already enabled.
